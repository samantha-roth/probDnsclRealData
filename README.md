## Probabilistic Downscaling for Flood Hazard Models

## Overview
This repository stores the entire workflow for the paper "Probabilistic Downscaling for Flood Hazard Models." This includes all data and code used in the analysis and all generated figures.


## Setup

This workflow has been tested using R version 4.2.1 (Funny-Looking Kid) on a laptop operating under Windows 10 with a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz processor and a 64-bit operating system. This workflow has also been tested using R version 4.4.2 (Pile of Leaves) on laptops operating with (1) macOS Sequoia 15.2 and an Apple M3 chip and (2) macOS Sonoma 15.2 with an Apple M1 Max chip. To perform cost distance analysis, we use the Whitebox Workflows for QGIS plugin for QGIS version 3.34.10. To install the Whitebox Workflows plugin, follow installation instructions at https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbt_book/qgis_plugin.html.

The R packages, in the format "package (version)," required for this analysis are `terra` (1.7-3), `akima` (0.6-3.4), `DescTools` (0.99.54), `MASS` (7.3-58.2), `Matrix` (1.6-1.1), `fields` (14.1), `mvtnorm` (1.1-3), and `spam` (2.9-1). 
For the visualizations, the required R packages are `RColorBrewer` (1.1-3), `ggmap` (3.0.1), `osmdata` (0.2.5), `ggplot2` (3.4.4).

## Reproduction
To complete the analysis more quickly in chunks, perform the following steps:
1. In all bash files, replace `/Users/f007f8t/Documents` with the location of your `probDnsclRealData` folder. Edit the bash files as necessary to schedule R scripts to be run on your local machine or the cluster of your choice. Examples are provided for a Mac laptop.
2. Install the necessary R packages by running `installPackages.R` in the `code` folder.
3. Call the bash file `runCodeBeforeQGIS.sh`
4. Open QGIS.
5. Look under the section 'GIS Analysis- Distance Tools' under the Whitebox Tools section of the processing toolbar in QGIS. Select 'Cost Distance.'
6. From the folder `~/probDnsclRealData/data`, select the raster `bin10mat5m.tif` as the 'Input Source File' and the raster `norristown_5m.tif` as the 'Input Cost (Friction) File.' Under 'Output Backlink File,' specify the name `backlink_QGIS.tif` and the folder `~/probDnsclRealData/data`.
7. Hit 'Run.'
8. Call the bash file `runCodeAfterQGIS.sh`
9. Call the bash file `runCodePlots.sh`
10. Call the bash file `runCodeOtherStormsBeforeQGIS.sh`
11. Repeat steps 4-7, in step 6 replacing `~/probDnsclRealData/data` with `~/probDnsclRealData/data/flood2014`
12. Repeat steps 4-7, in step 6 replacing `~/probDnsclRealData/data` with `~/probDnsclRealData/data/flood2020`
13. Repeat steps 4-7, in step 6 replacing `~/probDnsclRealData/data` with `~/probDnsclRealData/data/floodfuture`
14. Call the bash file `runCodeOtherStormsAfterQGIS.sh` 


**To run each R script individually not using bash files, follow the steps below. All R scripts are located in the `code` folder.**

**Setup**
1. Install packages needed for the main analysis and visualization: `installPackages.R`

**Preliminary data processing**
1. In the `dataProcessing` folder, get the coordinates of the grid cells for the model runs at each model resolution: `getCoordsFromRuns.R`
2. In the `dataProcessing` folder, get the high resolution cells within the bounds of the business area of interest: `get5mCoordsAroundHWMs.R`
3. In the `dataProcessing` folder, get the 5m locations that are flooded at the 10m resolution near the HWMs: `getWetIndsAroundHWMs.R`
4. In the `dataProcessing` folder, get the adjusted projections based on 5m being the high resolution at and around the high water marks: `getAdjPredsAtAndAroundHWMs.R`

**Decide on a model structure for our model for the observations**
1. In the `evaluation` folder, get downscaled Xm flood heights to plug into model for high resolution cells contained by low resolution wet cells near the high water marks used for calibration: `dnsclAroundHWMs.R`
2. In the `evaluation` folder, get downscaled Xm flood heights to plug into model for high resolution cells at the same locations as the high water marks used for calibration: `dnsclAtHWMs.R`
3. In the `evaluation` folder, use downscaled Xm flood heights to obtain confidencence interval coverage and width: `compareBds.R`

**Use elevations to predict whether or not a cell is flooded**
1. In the `evaluation` folder, compute percent of cells flooded in different elevation groups: `floodbyElev.R`
2. In the `models` foler, fit a gaussian process to model the probability of flooding by elevation: `modelProbFloodbyElev.R`
3. In the `dataProcessing` folder, use these GPs to predict the probability of coming from the distribution of flood heights at each high resolution cell within a low resolution dry cell: `getProbFloodatDestLocs.R`

**Find and get the predictive distribution of flooded (at low res) sources cells for dry (at low res) destination cells**
1. In the `dataProcessing` folder, create a raster at each resolution where every location inside the low res flooded area =1 and every location outside the low res flooded area = NA: `costDistPrep_FloodArea.R`
2. Look under the section 'GIS Analysis- Distance Tools' under the Whitebox Tools section of the processing toolbar in QGIS. Select 'Cost Distance.'
3. Select the raster `bin10m.tif` as the 'Input Source File' and the raster `norristown_5m.tif` as the 'Input Cost (Friction) File.' Under 'Output Backlink File,' specify the name `backlink_QGIS.tif` and the folder `~/probDnsclRealData/data`.
4. Hit 'Run.'
5. In the `dataProcessing` folder, use the backlink file to find downscaled cell within the low res flooded area that maps to the destination outside the low res flooded area: `getFloodedCellFromBackLink.R`, then `getSourcesForDests.R`
6. In the `evaluation` folder, get downscaled Xm flood projections at source cells: `dnsclSource.R`

**Use the predictive distribution of flooded (at low res) sources cells to get the predictive distributions at dry (at low res) destination cells.**
1. In the `models` folder, get the mean of the distribution of flood heights from the corresponding source cell assuming that the distribution of flood heights at the destination cell does not come from the point mass at zero: `getMeanIfNot0ForDestCells.R`
2. In the `models` folder, compute the total probability of flooding at each high resolution cell within a low resolution dry cell: `probDestCellsWetVSDry.R`
3. In the `models` folder, compute the total probability of flooding (defined as flood height > 0.3m) at each high resolution cell within a low resolution dry cell: `probDestCellsFlood.3m.R`
4. In the `models` folder, compute the approximate CDF and PDF of the distribution of high resolution flood heights in each low resolution dry cell: `getCDFandPDFatDests.R`

**Evaluate Performance**
1. In the `evaluation` folder, get the percent of flooded and non-flooded cells identified for high resolution cells within low resolution dry cells: `sensitivityAndSpecificityWetCells.R`
2. In the `evaluation` folder, get the percent of flooded and non-flooded (where flooded is defined as having a flood height >0.3m) cells identified for high resolution cells within low resolution dry cells: `sensitivityAndSpecificity.3mWetCells.R`
3. In the `evaluation` folder, compare the mean of the distribution of flood heights for high resolution cells within low resolution dry cells to the high resolution flood heights: `comparePredMeanToTruthDest.R`
4. In the `evaluation` folder, for all high resolution cells, compute the mean absolute errors and 95% prediction interval coverage: `getTotalMAE95PIAccuracy.R`
